//! The `moo-rs` crate is a library for working with **MOO** (Machine-Opcode Operation) test files
//! that typically encode [Single Step Tests](https://github.com/singleStepTests/) (SST)s intended
//! for testing CPU emulators.
//!
//! It provides functionality to read, parse, and manipulate MOO test files that contain
//! initial and final CPU states including the state of registers and memory.
//!
//! ## Features
#![doc = document_features::document_features!()]
//! # Using moo-rs
//!
//! The main data structure provided by this crate is the [MooTestFile](prelude::MooTestFile) struct
//! that represents a **MOO** test file.
//!
//! ## Reading a MOO file:
//!
//! The most common way to read a **MOO** file is to use the [MooTestFile::read](prelude::MooTestFile::read) method.
//! This method takes any type that implements the [Read](std::io::Read) and [Seek](std::io::Seek) traits.
//! [Seek](std::io::Seek) can be provided by wrapping a slice in a [std::io::Cursor].
//! For files, you will likely want to wrap the file in a [std::io::BufReader] for speed, or just read
//! the entire file into memory first.
//!
//! Once a **MOO** file is read, you can access the test cases via the [MooTestFile::tests](prelude::MooTestFile::tests)
//! method which returns a slice of [MooTest](prelude::MooTest) instances.
